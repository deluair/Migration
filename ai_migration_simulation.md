# Migration

## AI-Driven Economic Displacement and Geographic Mobility Simulation Framework

### Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive economic simulation modeling the complex dynamics of AI-induced job displacement and subsequent internal migration patterns across the United States (2024-2030). The simulation is grounded in real-world data showing that 14% of workers have already experienced AI-related job displacement, with 40% of employers anticipating workforce reductions between 2025-2030 due to AI automation.

### Core Research Questions

1. **Economic Displacement Patterns**: How do varying rates of AI adoption across industries and regions create heterogeneous displacement pressures that influence migration decisions?

2. **Migration Response Heterogeneity**: What demographic, educational, and occupational characteristics determine whether displaced workers relocate versus retrain locally, given that 77% of AI-related jobs require master's degrees and 18% require doctoral degrees?

3. **Geographic Arbitrage Dynamics**: How do cost-of-living differentials, remote work opportunities, and regional economic policies influence destination choices, particularly the observed Sun Belt migration patterns and suburban shifts?

4. **Regional Economic Equilibrium**: What are the long-term implications for sending and receiving regions when high-skill workers concentrate in AI-resilient metros while leaving AI-vulnerable manufacturing and service communities?

5. **Policy Intervention Efficacy**: How effective are targeted interventions like relocation subsidies (e.g., Tulsa Remote's $10,000 grants) versus retraining programs in mitigating displacement-induced economic disruption?

### Simulation Architecture

#### Multi-Agent Framework
- **Individual Agents**: 500,000 synthetic workers with detailed demographic, educational, occupational, and financial profiles
- **Firm Agents**: 50,000 companies across sectors with varying AI adoption curves and labor demand functions
- **Regional Agents**: 384 Metropolitan Statistical Areas with distinct economic structures and policy environments
- **Government Agents**: Federal, state, and local entities implementing displacement mitigation policies

#### Economic Displacement Module

**AI Penetration Rates by Occupation**:
- Finance/Data Analysis: 67% task automation potential
- Sales Representatives: 67% task automation potential
- Market Research Analysts: 53% task automation potential
- Manufacturing: 2 million workers displaced by 2025
- Managerial Roles: 9-21% automation risk

**Displacement Timing Model**: Implements "gradually then suddenly" pattern where displacement accelerates during economic downturns (40% recession probability in 2025)

**Sectoral Heterogeneity**: Incorporates that larger enterprises are twice as likely to adopt AI compared to smaller firms, creating spatial clustering of displacement

#### Migration Decision Framework

**Financial Constraints Model**:
- Liquid savings distributions by demographic cohort
- Moving cost functions ($5,000-$25,000 range with distance and household size adjustments)
- Income replacement expectations in destination markets
- Housing affordability calculations (remote work enables 20% of workers to afford previously unattainable locations)

**Social Network Effects**:
- Family proximity preferences weighted by age and marital status
- Professional network density in potential destinations
- Community tie strength degradation functions

**Labor Market Integration Probabilities**:
- Skills transferability matrices across metro areas
- Remote work feasibility (20% of workers plan to relocate in 2025, with 49% choosing suburban destinations)
- Industry cluster co-location benefits

#### Geographic Economic Models

**Regional Classification System**:
- **Tech Hubs**: SF Bay Area, Seattle, Austin, Boston (high AI creation, selective displacement)
- **Traditional Manufacturing**: Rust Belt metros (high vulnerability to AI automation)
- **Sun Belt Growth**: Miami (+30% software workers), Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego (rapid tech worker influx)
- **Emerging Tech**: Madison WI, Provo UT, Lincoln NE (university-anchored growth)
- **Rural/Small Metro**: Limited AI adoption but constrained absorption capacity

**Cost Structure Modeling**:
- Housing cost indices with supply elasticity parameters
- Local wage premiums/discounts by occupation
- State and local tax variations affecting net migration benefits
